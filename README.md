# Snake
Snake Game!

## How to install
- Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `yarn` and wait for the installation to finish
- Then run `yarn run build`
- Open `index.html` in your browser
- Play!
- If you don't wanna install, you can play it online [here](https://semsogutlu.github.io/snake/src/index.html)

## How it works?
- The purple square is your snake
- Your snake is vegan and hungry
- To keep your snake happy, you should eat the green food squares
- Snake grows each time it eats a piece of food
- You can control the snake with arrow keys of your computer
- Watch out - if you hit the wall or your tail the game is over
- If your snake dies, refresh the page to play again

## Future TODOs
- Scoreboard
- A local high score list
- Ability to start a new game without refreshing the page
- Build a UI to play on the phone
- Make the game harder overtime by speeding up the snake
